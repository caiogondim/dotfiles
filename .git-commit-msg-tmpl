# Short summary (80 characters max)

# More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 80 characters
# or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the subject of an email
# and the rest of the text as the body. The blank line separating the summary
# from the body is critical (unless you omit the body entirely); tools like
# rebase can get confused if you run the two together.

# Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug" or
# "Fixes bug". This convention matches up with commit messages generated by
# commands like git merge and git revert.
